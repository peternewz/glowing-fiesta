Yet Cherubini has left his homeland - and superstar status - for New York. <br />He has decided to start from scratch in a city that inspired his love of hip hop in the 1980s and led him to introduce rapping to the land of opera. <br />Since the 1990s, Jovanotti has incorporated classical, ska, funk, Latin music and more into his music, and collaborated with Amadou &amp; Mariam, Ben Harper, The Beastie Boys and the late Luciano Pavarotti, among others.</p>
